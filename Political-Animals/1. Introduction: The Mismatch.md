# Introduction: The Mismatch

BG Story: 1891 Beach Haven, Shark --> Trust science or instinct?
Instinct: sophysicated, but not always right.
Behaviors associated with 4 specific kinds of failures:
1) Many of us frequently disengage, becoming apathetic 【curiosity】
   hunmans are by nature curious, with a few strokes on a computer keyboard we can find the answer to any question that occurs to us.
3) We often don't correctly size up our leaders 【Mind reading】
   one of the critical diff. human and all other creatues is the ability to read one another's intentions, which develops by the age of four. （作者质疑，但是对政客的理解是有距离的，与直接接触身边人的理解完全不同。所以这种论证质疑不严谨。）
5) We punish politicians who tell us the hard truths 【Realism】
6) We often fail to show empathy in circumstances that clearly cry out for it. 【Empathy】
   we don't feel their pain but we experience the same emotions they are feeling. 
   
   In politicst, these 4 don't work. They malfunction, misfire and lead us astray.
   Why?
   Answer: our instincts were baked into human DNA in Pleistocene, 99% of the time we're on the planet. Modern politics is so different than the time in Pleistocene, we were not designed for that. Biologists estimate fundemental changes in species take up to 25k years. It has been only 10k years we live as hunter-garthers in Pleistocene, 400 generations. This is the gap we are up against. 
   
   Our modern skulls house a stone age mind.
